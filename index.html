    <h1><b>Why</b></h1>
        <p align = "justify">This website is more likely my resume. Here I have spoken about all my life experiences, achievements, projects, research, publications and many more. Since I love web designing. I wanted to build a website from scratch and decided not to use any frameworks (website generator). Instead, I started coding this using HTML5, Bootstrap4, CSS4 and Javascript. By doing this, it will also increase my programming skills. Therefore, I built this website from scratch.</p>
        
        
        <h1><b>When</b></h1>
        <p align = "justify">I started building this website on April 13, 2019. Since its web design new designs, new design layouts icons keep updating. So this is an ongoing project. I am the only one building this project. It involves no team mates in building this website. So eventually it takes time to build such websites because all the documenting, research and learning will be done by me. So I will be regularly updating the website with extended features.</p>
        
        
        
        <h1><b>How</b></h1>
        <p align = "justify">As said earlier I am building this website everything from scratch. I am using HTML5 to build the front-end, CSS4 for the styling, Bootstrap4 for the responsiveness of the website and Javascript for the animations. I am using Brackets IDE to type my code. This is an amazing IDE with extended features like “live preview” on a browser, auto code completion, syntax highlighting and many more. </p>
